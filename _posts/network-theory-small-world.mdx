## Intro

It is often said that all pairs of individuals in the world can reach each other
in a chain of no more than six acquaintances. This idea of **six degrees of
separation** can be represented as a property of a mathematical network called
the **small world** property and has been shown to be true for models that are
built to match characteristics of social networks in the real world.

**Network theory** is a branch of applied mathematics interested in the study of
the structure of graphs where the nodes and edges represent objects and
relationships for example friends in a social group, flights between airports or
websites on the internet.

## Small world property

How could we define a small world mathematically? If we take any pair of random
individuals and find the minimum number of acquaintances in a chain starting
from one person to the other then we can equivalently represent this as the
shortest path (called a **geodesic**) between two nodes in a social network
where the nodes represent individuals and the edges represent being acquainted
with each other.

A small world can then be defined as a network where the average shortest path
length $\ell$ grows slowly compared to the number of nodes in the network $n$.
More formally:

$$
\ell = O\bigl(log(n)\bigr) \quad \text{ as } n\to\infin
$$

In other words, for sufficiently large $n$, the degrees of separation grows at
most logarithmically.

## Milgram experiment

In the 1960s an American social psychologist named Stanley Milgram conducted an
experiment with a team from Harvard to find $\ell$ in the US. The experiment is
summarized as follows:

1. Begin by delivering packages to selected start individuals in the states of
   Nebraska and Kansas. The package contained a letter with the official Harvard
   crest explaining the experiment and a list to record the recipient's own
   name.
2. The recipient was instructed to attempt to forward the letter to a target in
   Boston, either directly if they knew them on a first name basis, or to
   someone they believed would be socially closer to the target.
3. After repeating the previous step and the target successfully received the
   letter, check the list of names to analyze the path taken through the social
   network.

In one of these experiments 18 out of 96 letters successfully completed a
journey from the start to the target. Out of these paths, the average path
length was 5.9 which provided early empirical evidence supporting the theory of
"six degrees of separation".

## Erdős–Rényi model

The Erdős–Rényi model $G(n,p)$ is a simple random graph model for generating a
network. In this model we have a fixed number of vertices $n$ and each of the
$n \choose 2$ possible edges between pairs of vertices is present with
probability $p$ independently. This model has the small world property, in fact
as $n$ grows large, almost all paths have the same shortest length.

An intuition for this can be thought of by considering a single node and the
expected number of neighbours it can reach within a certain distance $x$. The
average number of neighbours of a node in $G(n,p)$ is
$\langle k \rangle = (n-1)p$ as there are $n - 1$ possible edges to nodes
excluding yourself each present with probability $p$. For large $n$ at a
distance of $x$ we can then roughly reach $(n-1)^xp^x$ nodes.

**Number of friends reachable in $G(n,p)$ at a distance of $x$**

To reach all nodes at the shortest distance $\ell$ we then have:

$$
\begin{align*}
                &&       (n-1)^\ell p^\ell &\approx n \\
\implies \qquad && \langle k \rangle ^\ell &\approx n\\
\implies \qquad &&                    \ell &\approx log_{\langle k \rangle}(n) \\
\implies \qquad &&                    \ell &\approx O\bigl(log(n)\bigr)
\end{align*}
$$

However, the Erdős–Rényi model does not share other characteristics of real
world networks.

The **degree distribution** of a network is the probability distribution of the
**degree** (number of edges of a node) over the whole network. For $G(n,p)$ the
degree distribution is binomial which does not match observations of most
networks in the real world which typically have a larger variance of degrees
with many nodes having a low degree and a small number of nodes acting as hubs
with a large degree.

The **clustering coefficient** of a network is a measure of how much nodes tend
to group together. A version of it can be defined as the ratio between the
number of triangles (a triplet of nodes with all three possible edges between
them present) and the number of connected triplets (a triplet of nodes with only
two edges between them) in the network. For $G(n,p)$ the expected clustering
coefficient is $p$ as $n$ grows large which is low for small $p$. This also does
not match observations of most networks in the real world which typically
exhibit a high clustering coefficient.

## Watts-Strogatz model

The Watts-Strogatz model followed the Erdős–Rényi model and was designed to
achieve both a high clustering coefficient and the small world property via an
edge rewiring mechanism.

We start with an initial ring lattice with $N$ nodes with each node having
degree $K$ with edges to the nearest $\frac{K}{2}$ nodes to the left and the
nearest $\frac{K}{2}$ nodes to the right. Here we demonstrate $N=12$ and $K=4$:

![watts-strogatz-ring](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/watts-strogatz-ring.png)
**Initial ring lattice with $\frac{NK}{2}$ edges**

For each node we consider the $\frac{K}{2}$ edges to the nodes to the left and
with probability $\beta$ rewire the edge randomly to another node that does not
already have an edge to the current node:

![watts-strogatz-rewire](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/watts-strogatz-rewire.png)
**Rewiring of an edge with probability $\beta$ in the Watts-Strogatz model**

Repeating this rewiring step over all nodes we complete the random graph:

![watts-strogatz-finish](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/watts-strogatz-finish.png)
**Completed random graph generated from rewiring process**

The rewired edges can be thought of as "shortcuts" or "wormholes" through the
network and significantly decrease the average shortest path length $\ell$. It
makes sense then that as $\beta$ increases, $\ell$ rapidly approaches its
limiting value $\ell \approx \frac{\ln N}{\ln K}$ at $\beta = 1$ and the network
has the small world property.

The clustering coefficient in the initial ring lattice is high as the edges to
close neighbours means that neighbours tend to form cliques. This drops as
$\beta \to 1$ and the edges become completely random but in the intermediate
values of $\beta$ we achieve both a high clustering coefficient and the small
world property.

The main drawback of the model is the unrealistic homogeneity of the degree
distribution. In the initial ring lattice all nodes have degree $K$ and after
rewiring the degree distribution is still centred around $K$. The rewiring
process also only works on a fixed set of nodes and so cannot model a growth
process of adding new nodes to the network.

## Barabási–Albert model

The Barabási–Albert model uses a preferential attachment mechanism in order to
achieve both a heterogeneous degree distribution and the small world property.

We start with an initial set of $m_0$ nodes and edges such that the graph is
connected and choose $m <= m_0$ such that at each step we add a new node to the
network with $m$ edges to existing nodes in the network. Here we demonstrate the
preferential attachment process with $m_0 = 5$ and $m = 1$.

![barabasi-albert-initial](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/barabasi-albert-initial.png)
**Initial network with $m_0$ = 5**

When adding a new node to the network we choose $m$ existing nodes to add edges
to. The probability $p_i$ that we attach to an existing node $i$ is weighted by
its degree $k_i$ using the distribution $p_i = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j{k_j}}$. Hence,
highly linked nodes are "preferred" and more likely to accumulate more edges.

![barabasi-albert-one-step](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/barabasi-albert-one-step.png)
**Network after one step of growth with $m = 1$**

Repeating this process for a second step we add a second new node and connect it
to another existing node weighted by its degree:

![barabasi-albert-two-steps](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/barabasi-albert-two-steps.png)
**Network after two steps of growth with $m = 1$**

We repeat this process until we reach the desired network size:

![barabasi-albert-final](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/barabasi-albert-final.png)
**Final network after repeating growth by preferential attachment**

Notice that preferential attachment leads to hub and spoke network with a small
number of highly connected hub nodes serving as gateways to reach other nodes in
the network where there are many spoke nodes with a small number of edges. This
can also be thought of as "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer" effect
where well established nodes continue to get richer in edge count whereas newer
nodes struggle to gain new edges.

The degree distribution in fact follows a power law distribution which is known
as a **scale free network**.

![barabasi-albert-power-law](/assets/blog/network-theory-small-world/barabasi-albert-power-law.png)
**Power law degree distribution**

The hub and spoke structure leads to a low average shortest path length with
$\ell \approx \frac{log N}{log log N}$ asymptotically so the Barabási–Albert
model has the small world property. Preferential growth allows simulating
network growth and produces a similar degree distribution to real world examples
such as airport hub and spoke networks where major hub cities are more likely to
attract new flights rather than smaller less desirable locations.

Unfortunately, the clustering coefficient in the Barabási–Albert model also
follows a power law and therefore is small when the network is large.

## Conclusion

We have defined mathematically what it means for a network to be a small world
and introduced three models which all exhibit the small world property with
their own drawbacks when comparing to real world networks. Hopefully, this
provides more insight into the phrase "six degrees of separation", in fact with
modern technology perhaps this should be closer to three and a half!
