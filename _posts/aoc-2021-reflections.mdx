## Intro

I thoroughly enjoyed working through the [Advent of Code] 2021 problems this
year and feel accomplishment after attaining all 50 stars. My language of choice
this time was Python 3.10 which was refreshing to play with some of the modern
features given I work mostly in TypeScript these days.

## Tools

The supporting toolchain for Python I used to write code quickly was:

- black
- isort
- flake8
- mypy

The addition of [PEP 484] and application in `mypy` felt similar to TypeScript
with flexible typing on top of a dynamically typed language allowing for fast
iteration. The combination of `black`/`isort`/`flake8` for formatting and
linting also worked great as the analog of `prettier`/`eslint` for JS.

## Solutions

Check out my repo [tzyl/aoc21] for full solutions and accompanying notes
explaining the high level techniques employed.
