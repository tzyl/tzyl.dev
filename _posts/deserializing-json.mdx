## Intro

A common workflow when writing software is to take data received from an
external source such as a network request to an API or a file and deserialize it
into an in memory object. The reverse process is also true of serializing an in
memory object to transfer over the network or to persist into a file. The most
widespread data format for this is [JSON](https://www.json.org/) due to its
simplicity and ability to inspect its human readable contents.

We'll show how to interact with JSON data with TypeScript, Python, Java and Go
and make some observations along the way. More specifically we'll focus on
deserialization using the standard library where possible to keep code snippets
pure and simple although in production you may prefer other libraries for
example to construct HTTP requests.

Throughout this post we'll use the fake API from
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as an example. The
schema of the JSON todo data loaded from
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1` looks as follows:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

## Untyped deserialization

To start with let's take a look at loading JSON data in an untyped way. This
might be useful in quick one off scripts or dynamic situations where the exact
schema of the data may not be known up front.

### TypeScript

Given that all JSON is valid as a JavaScript expression (hence the name
JavaScript Object Notation) it's unsurprising that working with JSON is
straightforward. When using the Fetch API,
[`Response.json()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json)
resolves JSON in a response body to a JavaScript object. Alternatively,
[`JSON.parse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)
may be used when working with string content from a loaded file.

Note that in JavaScript the `number` type is a double precision floating point
number whereas the JSON spec does not require a specific precision. In practice,
for interoperability it may be expected that double precision floating point
numbers are used in JSON or strings are used instead to avoid ambiguity over
loss of precision of large numbers.

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
const data = await response.json(); // any
const id = data.id; // any
const userId = data.userId; // any
const title = data.title; // any
const completed = data.completed; // any
const doesNotExist = data.doesNotExist; // any, undefined at runtime!
```

### Python

The Python dictionary is the analog to the JavaScript object for working with
key value data. Handling untyped data is natural as a dynamically typed language
although the addition of static type checking is possible on top through
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and type hints similar to the
addition of TypeScript on top of JavaScript. We can use
[`json.loads()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads) to
parse a string containing JSON data into a dictionary.

Note that JSON numbers will automatically be deserialized to either `int` or
`float` Python types depending on whether it can be represented as an integer.

```python
import json
import urllib.request

response = urllib.request.urlopen("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
data = json.loads(response.read().decode("utf-8"))  # Any
id = data["id"]  # Any
user_id = data["userId"]  # Any
title = data["title"]  # Any
completed = data["completed"]  # Any
does_not_exist = data["doesNotExist"]  # Any, KeyError at runtime!
```

### Java

This example uses the standard HTTP client API introduced in Java 11 together
with [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) one of the de facto
libraries for handling JSON in Java. We receive a `JsonNode` from the
`ObjectMapper.readTree()` method allowing us to access arbitrary JSON properties
in the tree structure.

Note that when calling methods such as `JsonNode.asInt()` to coerce the
underlying value to an `int` other JSON values other than numbers such as
booleans and strings may be accepted. If the value cannot be coerced to an `int`
the default value of the type will be returned which would be 0 for ints.

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers;

public class JavaExample {
    public static void main(String[] _args) throws URISyntaxException, IOException, InterruptedException {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(new URI("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"))
                .GET()
                .build();
        HttpResponse<InputStream> response = client.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofInputStream());
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        JsonNode data = mapper.readTree(response.body());
        int id = data.get("id").asInt();
        int userId = data.get("userId").asInt();
        String title = data.get("title").asText();
        boolean completed = data.get("completed").asBoolean();
        JsonNode doesNotExist = data.get("doesNotExist"); // null at runtime!
    }
}
```

### Go

The empty interface `interface{}` in Go allows working with data of an unknown
type. If we use [json.Unmarshal()](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Unmarshal)
on a pointer to a `map[string]interface{}` value we'll receive the deserialized
JSON object according to the specified types:

```
bool, for JSON booleans
float64, for JSON numbers
string, for JSON strings
[]interface{}, for JSON arrays
map[string]interface{}, for JSON objects
nil for JSON null
```

Note that numbers are always deserialized to `float64` when an interface value
is used so an explicit type conversion to `int` is needed if desired.

```go
import (
	"encoding/json"
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

response, err := http.Get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
defer response.Body.Close()

body, err := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

var data map[string]interface{}
err = json.Unmarshal(body, &data)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

id := data["id"].(float64)            // float64
userId := data["userId"].(float64)    // float64
title := data["title"].(string)       // string
completed := data["completed"].(bool) // bool
doesNotExist := data["doesNotExist"]  // interface{}, nil at runtime!
```

## Typed deserialization

Now let's consider how to deserialize JSON into typed objects allowing our code
to operate in a safer way and automatically catch mistakes such as a typo
accessing wrong field names.

### TypeScript

An explicit type annotation gives a hint to the TypeScript compiler on the type
we want it to treat the object as. Now the compiler knows what fields exist and
what types they should be it can catch errors on incorrect access (according to
the types it was told).

Note that this is compile time only and does not change the runtime JavaScript
code once compiled with any extra validation or type conversions - the exact
same JavaScript object is still used which may error at runtime if typed
incorrectly or subsequently mutated.

```typescript
interface Todo {
  userId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
const data: Todo = await response.json();
const id = data.id; // number
const userId = data.userId; // number
const title = data.title; // string
const completed = data.completed; // boolean
const doesNotExist = data.doesNotExist; // compile error!
```

### Python

The [`TypedDict`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/typed_dict.html) type
allows us to perform a very similar type annotation. When using
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to check static types we achieve
a similar level of protection at lint time.

Note that this is lint time only and again does not affect the executed code at
runtime.

```python
import json
import urllib.request
from typing import TypedDict


class Todo(TypedDict):
    id: int
    userId: int
    title: str
    completed: bool


response = urllib.request.urlopen("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
data: Todo = json.loads(response.read().decode("utf-8"))  # Todo
id = data["id"]  # int
user_id = data["userId"]  # int
title = data["title"]  # str
completed = data["completed"]  # bool
does_not_exist = data["doesNotExist"]  # typeddict-item error at lint time!
```

### Java

The first step is to define a class to deserialize data into. Here we define a
simple `Todo` plain old Java object (POJO) with standard getters and setters.
Jackson automatically works with these types of classes out of the box by
matching the field names based on the method names. Jackson annotations can
customise the deserialization behaviour such as `@JsonProperty` to remap field
names.

Note that this does change the runtime code. It creates new `Todo` objects
rather than `JsonNode` objects and by default, Jackson object mappers fail on
encountering unknown properties during deserialization.

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers;

public class JavaExample {
    public static void main(String[] _args) throws URISyntaxException, IOException, InterruptedException {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(new URI("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"))
                .GET()
                .build();
        HttpResponse<InputStream> response = client.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofInputStream());
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Todo todo = mapper.readValue(response.body(), Todo.class);
        int id = todo.getId();
        int userId = todo.getUserId();
        String title = todo.getTitle();
        boolean completed = todo.getCompleted();
        JsonNode doesNotExist = todo.getDoesNotExist(); // compile error!
    }

    private static final class Todo {
        private int id;
        private int userId;
        private String title;
        private boolean completed;

        public int getId() {
            return id;
        }

        public void setId(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public int getUserId() {
            return userId;
        }

        public void setUserId(int userId) {
            this.userId = userId;
        }

        public String getTitle() {
            return title;
        }

        public void setTitle(String title) {
            this.title = title;
        }

        public boolean getCompleted() {
            return completed;
        }

        public void setCompleted(boolean completed) {
            this.completed = completed;
        }
    }
}
```

### Go

Instead of deserializing into the empty interface we can define and deserialize
into a `struct`. The field names are matched to `struct` field names accepting
case-insensitive matches. Alternative field names may be used by adding extra
metadata in [struct tags](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal) such as
`` Field int `json:"myName"` ``

Note that similar to Java this does have an effect at runtime for example
choosing to deserialize numbers as ints rather than `float64`.

```go
import (
	"encoding/json"
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

type Todo struct {
	Id        int    `json:"id"`
	UserId    int    `json:"userId"`
	Title     string `json:"title"`
	Completed bool   `json:"completed"`
}

response, err := http.Get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
defer response.Body.Close()

body, err := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

var data Todo
err = json.Unmarshal(body, &data)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

id := data.Id                     // int
userId := data.UserId             // int
title := data.Title               // string
completed := data.Completed       // bool
doesNotExist := data.DoesNotExist // compile error!
```

## Data constraints

Going further than simply parsing we may want to enforce data constraints
relevant to the objects in our data model.

Some of these may be inherent to the deserialization itself such as:

- Treat missing or null values for array fields as an empty array
- Remove null elements inside arrays
- Fail on extra fields sent that we do not recognise

This category of data constraint can often be tuned for example with Jackson's
[DeserializationFeature](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/wiki/Deserialization-Features).

Others may be relevant to business logic or necessary for the object as a whole
to make sense for example invariants between fields:

- Max length of string for a title
- Non-negative integer value for a page size
- Value matches expected format like a book ISBN number

For TypeScript and Python, these will obviously require extra code changes at
runtime and will make the deserialization perform closer to the given Java and
Go examples. Ideas to explore in this direction are:

- Typescript
  - [`zod`](https://zod.dev/)
- Python
  - [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
  - [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
  - [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/) and [`cattrs`](https://catt.rs/)
- Java
  - [JSR 380](https://beanvalidation.org/2.0-jsr380/) and the
    `jakarta.validation.constraints` annotations
  - [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) with precondition check methods
- Go
  - [go-playground/validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) also exists as a standard for defining a
schema for JSON data with validator implementations for all of the popular
programming languages.

### Conclusion

One of the main purposes of JSON is for interoperability between different
software boundaries. It's interesting to take a fundamental task such as
deserializing JSON and compare side by side how different languages and their
libraries approach it.

Notably, Java stands out as requiring an external library to perform basic
parsing and potentially even further libraries for cutting down boilerplate code
through codegen of standard getter/setters. I'm personally a fan of the mix of
conciseness and out of the box safety provided by Go in this case without the
need for a lot of work to setup additional tools.
